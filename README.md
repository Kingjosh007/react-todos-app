# React ToDos App

> This is a full to-do app that I created following [a React tutorial](https://ibaslogic.com/react-tutorial-for-beginners/).

The tutorial was divided into 11 parts. Refer to the corresponding branch for each part. The branch in bold is what I'm working on:

- 0: Setup
- 1: React basic concepts
- 2: Working with React form and handling events
- 3: Implement CSS in React app
- 4: Edit to dos items
- 5: Persisting React state in local storage
> Since this was just about learning how to use the Local Storage in the browser, which I'm already familiar with, I decided to skip this part 5.

- 6: Getting started with React lifecycle methods
- 7: Getting started with React hooks
- **8: Use SVG icons in React**
- 9: Routing with React Router
- 10: Add hamburger menu in React
- 11: Deploying React app to Github Pages
