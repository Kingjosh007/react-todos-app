# Math-Magicians

> This is the first project of the Math Magicians application, where I set up the environment and tools needed to develop a React application. 

"Math magicians" is a website for all fans of mathematics. It is a Single Page App (SPA) that allows users to:

- Make simple calculations.
- Read a random math-related quote.

I learned how to use React by building this application. The app was divided into seven (7) milestones. That in bold is what I'm working on:

- **Project 1: Setup**
- Project 2: Components
- Project 3: Events
- Project 4: Refactor with hooks (pair-programming)
- Project 5: Full website
- Project 6: Tests (pair-programming)
- Exercise: Deploy


## Live Demo

This project is not deployed yet. It will be deployed later to **Heroku** and **Netlify**.
